# MedicalCharges
This project involves exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing and predictive modeling on medical cost data. The data set contains information about patients' age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and medical charges.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
<ul>
  <li>Perform exploratory data analysis on the medical cost data to gain insights into the data and identify patterns and trends.</li>
  <li>Test hypotheses about the relationships between various variables in the data set and medical charges.</li>
  <li>Build predictive models to predict medical charges based on patient characteristics.</li>
</ul>

## Data

## Methodology
The project involves the following steps:
<ul>
  <li>Perform exploratory data analysis on the data set, including univariate, bivariate and correlation analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data.</li>
  <li>Perform hypothesis testing on the data set to test the relationships between various variables and medical charges.</li>
  <li>Build multiple predictive models. </li>
</ul>

## Tools and Libraries Used
The project was implemented using Python and the following libraries:
<ul>
  <li>Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.</li>
  <li>Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.</li>
  <li>Scipy for hypothesis testing.</li>
  <li>Scikit-learn for building predictive models.</li>
</ul>

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing to gain insights into medical cost data and test hypotheses about the relationships between various variables and medical charges. It also demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to build predictive models based on patient characteristics.
